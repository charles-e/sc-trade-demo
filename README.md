# Safecoin Wallet 

A wallet implementation for Safecoin.  Supports typscript.

### Running the UI

Run `yarn` to install dependencies, then run `yarn start` to start a development server or `yarn build` to create a production build that can be served by a static file server.

### How we got here
Created with love by taking the Ara's spl-token-wallet and then wrapping it in the serum-dex-ui project structure to get something that allows typescript and still resolves the miriad
dependencies to work with BPF contracts developing on safecoin.

### Why we got here
In order to have a simple typescript enabled web-app base upon which to test and/or build more complicated web-apps
